## RDBMS
- Relational Database Management System is software that stores, manages, and manipulates data based on the relational model.
- Data is represented in tables (relations) with rows (records) and columns (fields).  
- RDBMS ensures _data integrity, consistency, and security_ while providing efficient access and management.  

## Key Features
1. Table-based structure 
   - Data is stored in tables with rows and columns.  
   - Each table has a unique name and can relate to other tables.  

2. SQL usage
   - SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to define and manipulate data.  
   - Common operations: database/table creation, insert, update, delete, query.  
   - SQL dialects may differ by DBMS.  

3. Data integrity 
   - Supports constraints: Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique, Check.  
   - Transaction processing with ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ensures reliability.  

4. Relationships
   - Defines relations between tables to minimize redundancy and maintain referential integrity.  
   - Types: 1:1, 1:N, N:N.  

5. Data security
   - User access control and encryption strengthen security.  
   - Permissions can be set at database, table, or column level.  

## Main Functions of RDBMS
- Data Definition : create/manage tables, views, indexes, schemas.  
- Data Manipulation : insert, update, delete, query data.  
- Data Control : manage transactions, concurrency, recovery.  
- Data Security : configure user privileges, encryption, audit logs. 

## Definition of SQL
- Structured Query Language (SQL) is a programming language designed to manage RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems).  

### How does SQL work?
To instruct a computer to retrieve certain data, two basic pieces of information are needed:  
1. **What** to retrieve.  
2. **From where** to retrieve it.  
( "SQL로 데이터를 조회한다" → 영어로는 보통 retrieve data / query data 라고 표현. )

SQL expresses this information in a way both computers can execute and humans can understand.

Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```
1. `SELECT` means retrieve data
2. `*` means all columns
3. `FROM users` means from the users table
4. `;` means end of statement

## Types of SQL

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)
  - Used to manage data inside tables: query, insert, update, or delete records.
  - Main commands: **SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE**

Together, these are known as CRUD:

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

### DDL (Data Definition Language)
  - Defines and manages database objects such as tables and columns. Used to create, alter, or drop storage structures.
  - Main commands: **CREATE, DROP, TRUNCATE** (removes all rows from a table at once.)

### DCL (Data Control Language)
  - Manages access permissions and database security.
  - Main commands: **GRANT, REVOKE**

### TCL (Transaction Control Language)
  - Controls transactions, which are units of database operations. Ensures integrity in multi-step processes (e.g., transferring money between bank accounts).
  - Main commands: **COMMIT, ROLLBACK**


## Key Terms

1. **Table**  
   - The basic unit of data storage in an RDBMS, organized into rows and columns.  
   - If an Excel file is considered a database, then a table is similar to a *sheet* in Excel.  
   - Each table has a unique identifier called a **Primary Key (PK)**.  
   - The Primary Key uniquely identifies each row in the table.  
   - When creating relationships between tables, a **Foreign Key (FK)** is used.  

2. **Column**  
   - Represents an attribute (Java: *field*) in a table, stored in a vertical line.  
   - Each column can have a name, data type, size, and constraints.  
   - For example, in Java `String studentName;` is similar to defining a column name and its data type.  

3. **Row**  
   - A single horizontal line in a table; also called a **record**.  
   - Represents one unit of data stored in the table.  
   - Data is usually processed at the row level when inserted, queried, or updated.  
   - (In Java terms, a row is similar to an **object**.)  

4. **Primary Key (PK)**  
   - A value (or set of values) that uniquely identifies each row (object) in a table.  
   - Like an `id` attribute in HTML, the PK must be unique and cannot be duplicated.  
   - A PK can consist of a single column or a combination of multiple columns.  

5. **Foreign Key (FK)**  
   - A column that references the **Primary Key** of another table, defining a relationship between the two.  
   - Used when performing join operations between tables.  
   - Usually has the same data type and size (e.g., `INT`, `LONG`) as the referenced Primary Key. 


## SQL Basics
SELECT → choose columns

FROM → choose table

WHERE → filter rows (conditions, AND, OR, IN, LIKE)

ORDER BY → sort results

LIMIT → restrict number of rows
### SELECT
- Used to **retrieve data** from a database.  
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 
  FROM table_name;
```
Example without table:
```sql
SELECT 'Hello SQL!';
SELECT 12 + 7;
```
Example with aliases (AS):
```sql
SELECT 
  'Find' AS First, # a method for assigning an alias to a column
  'Insight' AS Second,
  'with SQL' AS Third;
```
→ Use commas (,) to insert multiple row values in sequence

### FROM
  - Specifies the table to retrieve data from.
  - `*` means all columns (wildcard).
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT id, name FROM products;
```
  - Limit results:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products LIMIT 3;
```

### Where
- Filters rows based on conditions.
```sql
SELECT * 
  FROM table_name 
  WHERE condition;
```
Examples:
```sql
-- country = Korea and marketing agree = 1
-- boolean type - 0 = false, 1 = true
SELECT * FROM users 
  WHERE country = 'Korea' 
    AND is_marketing_agree = 1;
-- country not Korea
SELECT * FROM users 
  WHERE country != 'Korea';

-- created_at between two dates
SELECT * FROM users
  WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2010-12-01' AND '2011-01-01';
```

Use IN for multiple options:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
  WHERE country IN ('Korea', 'UK', 'USA');
```

Use NOT IN:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
  WHERE country NOT IN ('Korea', 'UK', 'USA');
```

Use LIKE for pattern matching:
```sql
-- Starts with S
SELECT * FROM users WHERE country LIKE 'S%';

-- Contains 'SQL'
SELECT * FROM articles WHERE title LIKE '%SQL%';
```
